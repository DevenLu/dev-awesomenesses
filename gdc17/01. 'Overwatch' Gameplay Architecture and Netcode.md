## Main

1. 基于 ECS (Entity/Component/System)

- 同步的粒度比基于 Actor 更好控制
- 设计上也更正交 （entity 上的每个 component 都与游戏世界的某个或多个系统模块 system 对应）
- component stores game states, and have no behaviors (no functions) 
- 当处理 XXX system 时，GetXXXTuples() 可以快速获取一个 tuple 列表，每个 tuple 内仅包含了跟这个 system 关联的几个组件（使用 tuple 解掉逻辑对 entity 的耦合很巧妙）
- 前一条的一个自然后果是 system 不再关心 entity 了，任何一个 system 仅处理跟它有关的 component subset
- component 上可以通过类型直接获取 sibling compoment :  comp->Sibling<AnotherCompomentType>()
- Entity Lifetime
    + Deferred Creation and Destruction -> Off-by-one frame bugs
    + Add Synchronous Creation after ship(!)

2. 工程及代码组织

- system 的实现仅需包含相关的 component 头文件，最小依赖
- 工具函数分两类：副作用越大，影响的 components 越广泛，调用地点控制越严格（比如某些特殊情况下移动玩家的函数）
- One lesson of this talk to take away:
    + Behaviors are much less complex, if they are expressed in a single call site. Localize major side effects to that call site.

3. netcode

- to make a responsive network action game -> predicte players' actions (has been the jewel of honor for 20 years)
- A. (mis-predictions are side effects) reduce the chance by determinism
    + Synchronized Clock + Fixed Update + Quantization (16ms command frames)
    + A history of command frames are kept on client side to compare with authorized frames from server
    + When client receives a different frame (which is unexpected) it replays and resimulates all frames after it.
    + Tricky part: If frames are lost during the trip, server would continuously sync the state of the previous last command frame input with a message telling the packet-lost. Client would then update and advance slightly faster (to provide more frames)
    + Server would use a bigger buffer to hold more frames from client; once the network is healthy, the buffer would be reduced back to the small one.
    + hit prediction wouldn't be reliable any more if you have a real high ping (above 200ms RTT) it's deferred and server result is used directly
- B. novel techniques
- C. reduced complexity through ECS
- using well-established tech in other aspects (General replication of entities / Remote entity interpolation / backwards reconciliation)

4. Rules of Play (Retrospective)
    1. Components have no functions
    2. System have no state
    3. Shared code lives in Utils
    4. Complex side effects should be deferred
    5. Systems can't call other systems 

5. Closing
    1. ECS is glue (minimizes coupling)
    2. Enforce constraints on your glue code
    3. Netcode is tricky, so decouple it (from the rest of the engine) using ECS

## Q & A

hold a second copy of the buffer (to hold temp modificaitons)~  double buffering is cool, easy and good for multithreading, but for highly interactive systems, it creates one frame delay and hurts responsiveness in general. Two components in Overwatch, one is InputStreamComponent (ring buffer for all inputs in last 2 seconds), the other is MovementStateComponent (movements for any mover for the last seconds).

About refactoring and modularity in general, "We rewrote the whole system multiple times" for perf (ormance) or for complexity or for organization purpose, or features.

how to deal with stuck when decided to change into Sync-Creation~ 二段遍历 [ iterating ] | [ newly-created ]

server running at 60Hz and client might be at 30Hz~ The answer is the simulation must run at 60Hz (shouldn't has to be the same as rendering)
the local simulation is cheap; the simulation of remote guys can be smoothed out if it runs above the budget.
